### About me
Hello there! I'm Ediel Chedlyramber, a Web frontend developer, mainly working with browser-side JavaScript.

I'm currently learning amateur-level drawing, animating, writing and composing. I uses Linux distros as my main working environments, but I will run Windows VMs when doing drawing and animation.

I also do translations for FLOSS software projects and MLP:FiM fandom works free-of-charge, but translations for proprietary softwares are not free-of-charge.

I tend to hide or fake my personal information whenever and wherever possible to keep anonymous.

You can find me [on Telegram](https://t.me/light_ascend_bot). You can also choose to contact me [via e-mail](mailto:dr0vxckr1_mxsnh2@tutanota.com). Only serious inquiries are allowed.
