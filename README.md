### About me
Hello there! I'm Ediel Chedlyramber, a Web frontend developer, mainly working with browser-side JavaScript.

I'm currently learning amateur-level drawing, animating, writing and composing. I uses Linux distros as my main working environments, but I will run Windows VMs when doing drawing and animation.

I tend to hide my personal information whenever and wherever possible. If you want to contact me directly about something, you can find me [on Telegram](https://t.me/light_ascend_bot).
